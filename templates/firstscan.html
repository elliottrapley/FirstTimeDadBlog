						<p>
							The day had arrived to see our baby on the ultrascan for the first time and we decided to go to a private clinic. The reason being is because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, partners were not allowed to attend NHS scans. Sarah thought it was the right thing to do for us to experience this together. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We booked the scan 2 weeks in advance and this appointment really couldn't come quick enough. We had a rough idea how far into the pregnancy we were. However, I have read stories on the internet regarding "phantom pregnancies" which is when a women experiences common symptoms of pregnancy but, then it turns out that she's not pregnant at all. I really hope Sarah wasn't expierencing this. I know she would be heartbroken if this is the case.
						</p>
						<p>
							Parked up outside the clinic and we had to wait outside as they were controlling the amount of people in the waiting room. We signed in and waited for our turn. I was so nervous. I could feel my heart beating hard in my chest and I don't know why I was nervous. I guess it's because it still doesn't feel real yet. That will soon change very shortly.  
						</p>
						<p>
							We were called in to the ultrasound room, Sarah laid down onto the bed and a large machine was looming at the top of her head. The sonographer spread the gel onto Sarah's tummy and placed the scanner straight onto the area and there it was. On the giant screen in front of us was our baby. It really was an incredible moment. The ladies in the room were laughing because our baby was moving around so much. To see our baby on the screen was incredibly warming and I couldn't hold back a few tears. After the scan, we purchased a few photo's and a movie of the scan to share with our close friends and family. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Later this evening, I've just kept on watching the scan video on loop. It really is incredible. I still get occassions where my little chatterbox in my head tells me "how can I financially support my child and my partner?", "I really hope I'm going to be a great dad". It usually happens at night when I'm trying to sleep. If you're reading this, does it happen to you as well? I'm generally fine during the day but, at night time, when I'm trying to sleep, my chatterbox in my head is like a circus. There's so much going on I just don't know where to look.
						</p>
						<p>
							For sleep, I've always found meditation very helpful. I use an app called Headspace which is widely known. I usually listen to short wind-down audios to help relax my mind and focus on my breathing. After this, I quite enjoy listening to some of the sleep stories that are available. They're 45 minutes long and if you focus your attention on the story, it really does help. I would recommend this if you struggle to sleep too. Of course, some of the other techniques that are recommend are regular exercise and to not be on your phone 1 hour before you sleep. 
						</p>
						<p>
							 I've always struggled with self-confidence for as long as I can remember. I've never been one to stand up for myself however, since knowing I'm going to be dad, there's now a fire burning inside me. A fire not associated with anger by a long shot but, one of pride. It's like a natural instinct to protect the one you love. You see it on animal documentaries when the mother and father defend there young against threats. It's like my body is telling me "hey! I'm a dad now! I'm not taking any crap from anyone or anything!". It's difficult to explain unless you've had a child(s) of your own.

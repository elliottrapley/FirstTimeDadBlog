						<p>
							We will be leaving to go to my Dad's first straight after Sarah had finished work. Sarah got home just after 6pm and we immediately set off. After arriving at my Dad's, Sarah and I were both pretty casual. We didn't let on that we had something big to tell them. We probably spent about one hour and 30 minutes with my Dad and my Step-Mum before we revealed our news.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Conversation was flowing really nicely and the topic of discussion was ironically about being more responsible and behaving like an adult whilst sorting out our new home during UK COVID-19 lockdown and I said "...speaking of adulting...". Shortly followed by "Sarah's pregnant". My Dad looked at us with frowning eyebrows whilst Sarah and I were giggling like a couple of mischievous pranksters. Dad responded "..are you joking?" to which our reply of course was "nope. We'er being serious. Sarah is pregnant." Dad seemed to be a bit teary, although it was difficult to see. He told us both that this was wonderful news. My Step-Mum said they coudn't wait to be grandparents. I was elevated to tell them this news. It was such a great feeling. Now onwards to Sarah's parents.
						</p>
						<p>
							Arriving at Sarah's parents, it seemed like any other visit. We didn't make it obivious we had huge news to tell them. I can sense Sarah is so eager to tell her Mum and Dad. Her parents have already had one grandchild from Sarah's older sister. Sarah's neice is coming up for 14 this year (end of 2020) so this will be their first grandchild in 14 years. We sat in the lounge very casually. The TV playing in the background and we're talking amongst ourselves. We stayed for couple of hours before we told them the news and it was approaching approximately 9pm. Sarah announced, "right..so..before we go...". A short pause and then followed by "so...how do you feel about your next grandchild?". Sarah's Dad's face lit up like a chandelier with diamonds. He gave Sarah an incredible tight hug and flooded us with congratulations. Sarah's Dad is a Technician for the Ambulance service and he has had an incredible tough year with the COVID-19 outbreak. This news for him was amazing. We emphasised that the pregnancy is still very early and wished to keep it amongst ourselves. We thought it was important to establish a support network around us.
						</p>
						<p>
							Next stop, my Mum and Step-Dad's house. You can probably guess by now that my parents are divorced. We arrived fairly late at about 09:30pm and again, made our usually casual entrance and not making it obvious at all that we had massive news to share. My sister had a friend over and was in another room. Sarah and I made our way into the main living area where my Mum and Step-Dad had setup base for the evening. After about an hour or so casually chatting away about our everyday lives, "how's work?", "how's the house", "What did you do at the weekend", Chloe came into the main living area and I said "Ah, good timing". Everyone looking at me with a somewhat frowning expression of confusion. 
						</p>
						<p>
							"Sarah's pregnant", I said. My Mum darted off the sofa and approached us with open arms as wide as a football pitch with watery eyes. Due to the pandemic, we had to sadly remind her of social distancing! My sister fell to the floor like a popped balloon. I'm ecstatic with the reaction and the support that Sarah and I have received. It's because of this my anxiety washed away.

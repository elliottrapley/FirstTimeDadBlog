						<p>
							Today was our NHS 20-week scan. It was the first one I could attend because previously, partners couldn't attend because of COVID-19. This is why we chose to go private for previous scans because I could attend. The hospital is only 11 miles from where we live which is ideal and the drive is quite pleasent actually. Of course, it was the first time I've seen the hospital that my son would be born in. We're fairly new to this area and we had a different local hospital before we moved.
						</p>
						<p>
							We parked up, proceeded to the antenatal ward and checked in. We had to have our temperatures checked to ensure we don't have high temperatures. In the waiting area, the chairs were spaced out as far from each other as possible and it was one chair per couple. The lady would sit and the men would stand next to them. Unless of course the lady was on her own.
						</p>
						<p>
							Very shortly we were called in to the scan room and Sarah lied down onto the bed. The gel was applied and we saw our little son straight away. He's getting so much bigger now. According to our pregnancy app, he's the size of a Maltese Puppy, or an aubergine (eggplant). Whilst on screen, he did a big strech and kicked his legs out. It was really cool to watch.
						</p>
						<p>
							The sonographer was great and she was very pleased with the growth. She could identify the four-chamber heart, the lungs, stomach and the measurements were good. The sonographer then said, "I can see very clearly it's a boy". Obviously takes after his dad! (sorry, a bit inappropriate). Sarah and I are extremely pleased with our son's progress. The photo's were printed and we can see clearly the side-profile of the baby. We can see the eye, tip of the nose and the mouth. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Later that night, I was lying in bed and I was reading about ways a dad could bond with their unborn baby. I saw a few articles which suggest just simply talking to the bump, singing, playing music. I also read that unborn babies can hear sounds from outside the womb more clearly at 25 weeks. I taught myself how to play the guitar a few years ago and it's just one of those hobbies for me that I just pick up and play, but don't play again for months. I better start practising! I would like my kid to learn an instrument when they grow a bit older. If they want to that is. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I couldn't really sleep. I don't know why I just kept thinking as usual. For some reason I was thinking about child care. Thankfully, it's worked out that Sarah can take approximately 11 months maternity which is amazing. After that though, she would need to go back to work and we need to arrange child care. I think we have our hearts set on Sarah's mother looking after our baby but, she still works part-time. I really need to stop worrying about this sort of thing because it's quite some time yet before we need to think about this. Also, it's amazing at what can change during a year. I think i'll start doing sleep aide relaxtion techniques again. My anxiety is quite bad as I have a dental mouth gaurd to protect my teeth from my grinding during sleep.
						</p>
						<p>
							Not sure when my next post will be. Christmas is approaching and our next scan is in January 2021. As of 5th November 2020, England is now in a nation wide lock-down because of rising COVID-19 cases. Until next time!

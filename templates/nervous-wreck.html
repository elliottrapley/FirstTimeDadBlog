						<p>
							This is when it really hit me hard. The next morning after Sarah had told me we're going to be parents. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Sarah had gone back to work. She starts work at 08:00 so she's out of the house before I am (even before I started working from home). I woke up and of course the first thing I thought of was the pregnancy. I felt the same as I did last night. Still in shock. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I rolled out of bed and went straight into the shower. For me, showers have always been a place of reflection. It has always been a time when my thoughts just seem to run wild and I just seem to think about my life. I think about What happened in the past, what I've got planned for the day and what could happen in the future. This time however, it was all about our new baby. I just didn't feel ready. Mentally, financially, our house, the garden, the cat, our parents and family, friends. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I do struggle with change and this a pretty big change to say the very least. The anxiety was building and now snowballing out of control. I started crying in the shower. I got out the shower, got dressed turned on my work laptop and went to get a coffee. Tears were streaming through all of these activities. I really felt the need to tell someone. I needed to talk to someone. 
						</p>
							I sat at my desk with my work laptop trying to stay in routine. Checking work emails, checking any missed phone calls. At about 09:30, my manager called me to ask me something about work. I answered his enquiries and but my voice breaking. "erm....erm...ahh...errmm". "Sarah told me last night...". You know when you try and talk when you're emotional and you get that lump in your throat? That's what was happening here. I couldn't get my words out. "Sarah told me she's pregnant". my manager responded, "oh wow!, congratulations!". Just hearing that word from my manager, 'congratulations' had me smiling straight away. I think it was the relief of telling someone. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Sarah said the night before that she would tell her manager that she's pregnant because they would need to put a risk assessment in place. I felt that I couldn't tell anyone because the news was still so fresh. But I just couldn't keep it inside. I definitely did the right thing by telling my manager. I felt that I had support straight away. I mentioned to my manager that I didn't feel ready. I said to him that I still feel like I'm 21 years old. I don't feel like a 29 year old at all. He responded to say that he was 30 when he had his first child and he felt the same as I did now. Feelings of not being ready. He said he could hear it in my voice that I was shaken up and he offered to meet up and grab a coffee.
						</p>
						<p>
							I called another one of my colleagues who I work closely with and told him of my news. He gave me his congratulations and reassured me that everything will be great. This is exactly what I needed to hear. I seem to need reassurance from people that everything will be fine.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sarah came home for lunch and was very sweet. She knew I had been crying and was comforting me. She's been amazing. We talked through our lunchbreak and things are definintely getting easier but, I'm still quite emotional. Sarah suggested that I speak to one of my closest friends who had recently become a father for the second time. I called my friend and of course, my voice was breaking again. My friend said "right! Are you at home? I'm coming over!". When my friend arrived, I told him. Sarah's pregnant. He responded, "that's amazing! Oh my god when you called me I thought something bad had happened to Sarah!". 
						</p>
						<p>
							I did feel a bit silly but, speaking to my mate who is a currently a dad made me realise that I'm not alone in this. I felt quite excited and I was looking forward to telling our parents the good news. Sarah and I agreed that we will visit each of our parents later in the evening.

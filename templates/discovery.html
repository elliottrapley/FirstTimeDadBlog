							<p>
							On a casual Wednesday evening, of course, not a lot happening, I was in the 2nd room of our house playing Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey on my gaming PC. This was about half 10 at night.  I’ve had the game installed for a while now but only played the introduction. So tonight, I thought I’d give it another go. I was only playing the game for about 5 minutes when Sarah came into the room telling me she has something to tell me. 
							</p>
							<p>
							On Tuesday earlier in the week, Sarah had come home early from work. She must have only been at work for about 45 minutes so, she got home at about 08:45am. She said that she was sick at work. As harsh as this sounds, I didn’t find this too surprising. Sarah occasionally feels sick sometimes and it’s not something that has happened before. She asked me if I was sick as well, I replied, “Nope, I feel fine” I did comment on the night before that I felt that I rushed cooking the chicken and I was a bit concerned I may not have cooked it properly. 
							</p>
							<p>
							I’m currently working from home due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the 2nd room in our house is where I've set up to work. I came downstairs mid-morning to check up on her and get a refill of coffee. She was asleep on the sofa, so I just left her to it. After a couple of hours, I came downstairs again, this was about lunch time and she awoke as I walked into the living room. I asked her, “How are you feeling?”  and she replied, “better actually”. Which is good. She shortly said she feels exhausted and she may have thought her body was telling her to slow down. She is a hard worker. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Later that afternoon, we were due to go and see a kitten that we were interested in. I travelled to Sunbury-On-Thames on my own and arrived to see the kitten at 3pm. I fell in love with it, so I paid the deposit (£100.00) and agreed we will collect the kitten on the 2nd August 2020. Throughout this time, Sarah was her normal self. I wouldn’t have thought she was tired or felt sick. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Wednesday morning, Sarah decided to stay off work because she still felt exhausted. She spent most of the day chilling on the sofa watching Supernatural on Amazon Prime Video. We were running quite low on milk and I did mention to Sarah that I would like to go to the shops to get milk. I had a Chiropractor appointment and when I returned at about 11:30, Sarah tried to call me. I walked through the door and she said wanted to know if I was stopping off at the shops. I said I’ll go later. 
							</p>
							<p>
							The day continued to be like any other day. I was working from home and Sarah seemed fine. She made herself a tuna pasta bake thing. She found the recipe online and wanted to try it out. 
							</p>
							<p>
							After I had finished work, I started cooking our dinner (only jacket potatoes and baked beans). After dinner, she said she was going to the shops. She followed this up with she wanting to go to Tesco supermarket in Warfield. I did think it was a bit strange going to a large supermarket to get some snacks when there is a perfectly good Londis shop less then 2 minutes’ walk. But I didn’t think too much into it. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Now we’re at Wednesday night. I’m casually playing my game and Sarah walks in. “Elliott, can I talk to you? I need to tell you something”. “I’m pregnant.”  I was frozen. I didn’t know whether she was joking or not. I even said to her “Really?” “I can’t tell if you’re joking or not”. She replied, “no I’m serious” as she’s wiping her eyes. That’s the reason why she wanted to go to Tesco! She wanted to get a test. I spent about 15 minutes just staring at the tests and reading the instructions. 
							</p>
							She bought a pack which contained two tests. Both showed positive. I read the packaging, I read online about the product. The product had extremely poor reviews on ASDA. We took the decision to drive to a 24/7 Waitrose at a fuel station (at 11pm) approximately 1 mile from our house. Luckily, they sold the ClearBlue tests. Two in one. Sarah took the test when she got home, we ensured we read the instructions thoroughly and bam, positive. 
							</p>
							<p>
							It didn't hit me as hard as I thought it did. Yeah, my heart was pumping faster but I still managed to get to sleep pretty quickly that night and slept through the night.
							</p>
							<p>
							The next morning, this is when it hit me hard. The flood gate of emotions had opened.

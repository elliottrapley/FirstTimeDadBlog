							This is going to be another brilliant scan and Sarah and I have been waiting for this day for a few weeks now...The 4D scan! Admittedly, I'm a bit behind writing this blog post as the 4D scan was on the 19th December 2020. We booked the scan back in November 2020 because Sarah had to be in a specific part of the pregnency which is 24 to 34 weeks. At the time of our scan, Sarah was a couple of days from 28 weeks. The clinic had a fantastic deal on the VIB (Very Important Baby) package and included the well-being scan (most important), the 4D scan some prints (including digital copies), the movie and a couple of key rings. We were going to choose this package regardless of the deal anyway but the deal was a nice touch. Sarah came up with the idea of keeping the scan a secret from our parents and we would use the print-outs as a Christmas present. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The day had arrived and I purposley booked a morning appointment because I didn't want to wait around! It's like waiting to board an aeroplane when you're excited to go away on holiday. We arrived at our usual clinic, signed in and waited for our turn. Sarah and I were actually quite nervous because when signing in, we were asked to read a terms and conditions document which said that if they can't see the baby on the 4D, we would be asked to go for a short walk, eat/drink something and come back for a re-scan. If they can't see the baby on the re-scan we would have to rebook the whole package. Once we sat down in the waiting area, I was looking at the display board which showed examples of the 4D scan which looked incredible. The detail you can see amazing and there was one picture of a baby that was sticking his/her tongue out! I was imaginging what our baby boy would look like...
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally it was our turn! We didn't wait for very long actually but we really couldn't wait to have our scan. We were escorted to the sonography room and introduced to the sonographer. The staff are so fantastic at this clinic and they really help fuel the excitment by showing their own enthusiasm. Most importantly, the first thing they did was carry out a well-being check of the baby. This included major organ positioning, heartbeat and measurements. It's fantastic to hear that our son is growing perfectly and his organs are exactly where they should be. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The next bit, the 4D scan. It truly was amazing to see our son on the 4D scan. I can see straight away that he seems to have inherited my nose. He looks incredibly sweet. On the scan, he was holding his umbilical cord and apparently babies like to put it in the their mouth while in the womb. I can keep writing how amazing it was but until you actually expierence it yourself, then you can truly feel how I felt on the that day. After the scan, we sat down in the waiting area and had a look at the photo's that were taken. We chose what ones we like printed and which ones to have as a key ring. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We left the clinic with a big spring in our steps. We loved the expierence and can't wait to see our baby in March 2021. This pregnency for me has gone by really quickly. However, I know Sarah has certinately had her struggles such as pain, aches, tiredness. I won't go into too much detail but you should all now the changes that occur when women grow another human inside them. It really is very admiring. If I was pregnent, I know I would find it extremeley hard because of the physical changes in your body as well as adjustments to your lifestyle. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I made a decision that I will propose to Sarah. It's something I was thinking about for a while, pretty much most of 2020. It wasn't until coming up to the end of the year that If I was going to do it, now is the time. So in 2020, we moved into our first home that we bought, Sarah fell pregnent and now we'er engaged. Sarah and I have agreed that we don't know when we will get married. It's something that will happen but our priorities is to have our child and improve our home. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Happy New Year! My next post will be in January 2021.

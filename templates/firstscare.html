						<p>
							Sarah has always described our baby as very active and she can normally feel him kicking, stretching and moving about very often. Sarah has recently started playing music and we've discovered he seems to like Ed Sheeran. Don't know why. I do like Ed Sheeran, I think he's very talented but I don't believe any of his songs are on my personal Spotify playlist. When ever Sarah plays Ed Sheeran we can often feel a few kicks. While writing this I've just thought, maybe he doesn't like Ed Sheeran and he's kicking to try and make it stop! (Sorry, Ed). 
						</p>
						<p>
							Last night when Sarah came home, she said she hasn't really felt the baby move much. She said she could feel the occasional kick but, no where near the usual movement she feels. It wasn't until about half 10 at night when we were in bed that we started to feel really concerned. Unfortunately, we did look online and read a few articles. We should really stop doing this. It's like when you're ill and read your symptoms online and you worry yourself that you have a serious illness. We read that the baby should be very active and you notice any changes, you should contact your midwife straight away. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Sarah called the telephone number in her pregnancy pack that was provided by the hospital. They advised to eat something and drink a cold glass of water followed by lying on your left hand side and really focus the attention on the baby. They said to call back in an hour if Sarah hadn't noticed any changes. It felt like a very long hour. I felt so tired and I struggling to keep my eyes open. I felt bad for Sarah because she was also trying to stay awake. After the hour Sarah said she didn't feel anything. The nerves were really kicking in and the midwife said to come to the labour ward at the hospital. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We arrived at the hospital and went straight to the labour ward. Sarah checked-in with the lady on the reception desk and I was told that I needed to wait outside. This is hospital measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. It was horrible sitting outside in the waiting area when I wanted to be with Sarah. Sarah was probably in there for about half an hour and it felt like such a long time. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I let out a huge sigh of relief. I had a text from Sarah to say everything is fine. When I received that message I did tear up. It was such a relief and it was just awful waiting outside. Of course, I asked Sarah what happened when she went into the ward. Sarah said that a lady attended to her and wanted to check the baby's heartbeat. At first, she couldn't find it which was very scary. Apparently the lady that attended to Sarah wasn't too familiar with baby's of our size and asked for a colleague to double check. Straightaway, her colleague found the heartbeat and it was very strong. I'm so grateful that we were able to go to the hospital at this time of night and get checked. The ladies said to Sarah that we did the right thing by coming in. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We got home at about half one in the morning. It was a late night but we're glad we did it and have peace of mind. Sarah got quite emotional when we got home and said she really doesn't want to feel like that again. I don't blame her. It frightening for both of us. 
						</p>
						<p>
							It's a daily question now when Sarah comes home from work. "Have you felt the baby move and kick today?". Sarah said the baby is moving around so much. I don't know what that was about. The nurses at the hospital said that baby's don't have a regular pattern until later in the pregnancy. Maybe he just wanted a chill day and couldn't be bothered to move much. I guess we'll never know. It sure was frightening.
